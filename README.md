WalkersGuide-Android
====================


WalkersGuide is a navigational aid primarily intended for blind and visual impaired pedestrians. It
calculates routes and shows nearby points of interest.  The project consists of an Android client
and a server component. The latter performs the route calculation. The map data is provided by
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), a project to create a free map of the world.

This repository contains the client application. It's written in Java and supports the Android
operating system since version 4.1. The application is fully accessible with Android's screen reader
Talkback.
